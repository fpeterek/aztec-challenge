# Aztec Challenge

Aztec Challenge, rewritten in Java for a school project. I do not like Java, I do not like programming in Java, nor do 
I agree with the probihition of static methods, unfortunately, such were the requirements.

Aztec Challenge is a a classical game that I, in no way, wish to mock or disrespect. This version is probably far from
perfect and far from the original, but as I said, it's a school project with requirements I highly disagree with, I'm not
proud of it, I was forced to create it this way.

## Licensing

All code written by me is open source, licensed under the Apache license. The same applies to any graphics I may have created 
myself, if I ever create my own graphics. If I steal graphics from the internet, sources will be mentioned.

## Compilation

This project uses Gradle as it's build system. You should, as is the convention in Gradle, utilize the Gradle wrapper.

Compile, type `./gradlew build`. To run the project, type `./gradlew run`. To create an executable .jar archive, type
`./gradlew jar`.
